# Python Functions – Revision

This folder contains structured revision examples of Python functions, 
prepared as part of my computational foundation for astronomy and cosmology research.

## Topics Covered

- Defining functions using `def`
- Function arguments and return values
- Conditional logic inside functions
- Returning multiple values
- Basic scientific calculations using functions

## Why Functions Matter in Scientific Computing

Functions are essential for:

- Writing reusable scientific code
- Organizing numerical workflows
- Reducing repetition in data analysis
- Structuring research projects cleanly

This revision is part of my preparation for scientific programming 
and astronomy workshop participation.
