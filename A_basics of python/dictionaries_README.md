# Python Dictionaries – Revision

This folder contains structured revision examples of Python dictionaries, 
prepared as part of my computational practice for astronomy and cosmology.

## Topics Covered

- Creating dictionaries
- Accessing values using keys
- Adding and modifying key-value pairs
- Looping through keys and values
- Conditional checks within dictionaries
- Using dictionaries to organize astronomical data

## Why Dictionaries?

Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making them ideal for structured scientific information.

In astronomy and cosmology, dictionaries are useful for:

- Supernova properties (redshift, magnitude, host galaxy)
- Star parameters (mass, temperature, spectral type)
- Dataset organization
- Storing computed cosmological quantities

This revision is part of my preparation for scientific computing and astronomy workshops.
