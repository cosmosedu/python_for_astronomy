# Python Tuples – Revision

This folder contains structured revision examples of Python tuples, 
prepared as part of my computational practice for astronomy research.

## Topics Covered

- Creating tuples
- Accessing elements (indexing)
- Tuple unpacking
- Iterating through tuples
- Using tuples inside lists
- Basic data structuring for astronomical objects

## Why Tuples?

Tuples are immutable data structures, meaning their values cannot be modified after creation.  
They are useful for representing fixed data such as:

- Coordinates (RA, Dec)
- Physical constants
- Astronomical object properties
- Structured records

## Example Use Case

Astronomy-related examples included in this folder demonstrate how tuples can represent:

- Star information (name, distance, type)

This revision is part of my preparation for scientific computing and astronomy workshops.

NOTE: This README.md made by AI based on my work that I Done.
