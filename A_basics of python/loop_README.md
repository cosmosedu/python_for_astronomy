# Python Loops – Revision

This folder contains structured revision examples of Python looping constructs, 
prepared as part of my computational foundation for astronomy and cosmology work.

## Topics Covered

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Conditional statements inside loops

## Why Loops Matter in Scientific Computing

Loops are essential for:

- Iterating through observational datasets
- Applying conditional filters (e.g., selecting bright supernovae)
- Performing iterative numerical calculations
- Simulating physical processes step-by-step

Although NumPy vectorization is preferred for performance, 
understanding loops is fundamental for:

- Algorithm development
- Convergence testing
- Custom data processing routines


This revision is part of my preparation for scientific programming 
and astrophysics workshop participation.
