# Numerical Tools – Vectorization and Basic Scientific Methods

This folder contains structured revision of numerical thinking in Python,
focusing on efficient scientific computation using NumPy.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Vectorization vs Loops
Comparison between:

- Traditional Python `for` loops
- NumPy vectorized operations

Vectorization allows element-wise computation without explicit loops,
resulting in cleaner and more efficient scientific code.

---

### 2. Performance Awareness
Basic comparison between loop-based computation and NumPy array operations
to understand efficiency differences in large datasets.

---

### 3. Numerical Integration

Introduction to numerical integration using:

- `np.trapz()` (Trapezoidal Rule)

Applied example:
- Numerical evaluation of ∫ x² dx
- Resolution refinement and convergence testing

Understanding convergence behavior is essential in computational physics.

---

### 4. Cosmology-Inspired Integration Example

Approximate evaluation of cosmological integrals using discretized redshift arrays.
This establishes the foundation for luminosity distance calculations
in Supernova Type Ia analysis.

---

### 5. Basic Error Propagation

Simple uncertainty estimation using fractional error propagation.

Applied example:
- Distance estimation from Hubble's Law
- Propagation of uncertainty in H₀

This prepares for quantitative uncertainty analysis
in cosmological parameter estimation.

## Why This Matters

Numerical methods are fundamental for:

- Cosmological distance calculations
- Supernova data analysis
- Model fitting
- Error estimation
- Scientific simulation

This notebook bridges basic Python knowledge
to computational astrophysics workflows.
