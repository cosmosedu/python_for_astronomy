# Matplotlib Basics – Scientific Plotting Foundations

This folder contains structured practice of basic scientific plotting 
using Matplotlib, developed as part of my computational training 
for astronomy and cosmology.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Line Plots
- Plotting numerical functions
- Understanding x–y relationships
- Basic visualization of mathematical models

### 2. Scatter Plots
- Visualizing observational-style data
- Redshift–velocity examples inspired by cosmology

### 3. Plot Elements
- Axis labeling
- Titles
- Legends
- Grid control

Emphasis was placed on proper scientific formatting:
- Clear axis labels
- Meaningful plot titles
- Clean visual structure

### 4. Figure Control
- Adjusting figure size using `figsize`
- Controlling line style, color, and width
- Saving high-resolution figures (`dpi=300`)

## Why This Matters for Astronomy

Scientific visualization is essential in astrophysics for:

- Hubble diagrams
- Luminosity distance plots
- Error analysis representation
- Observational data presentation

Well-structured plots improve clarity, interpretation, 
and professionalism in workshops and research settings.

This README file was drafted with the assistance of AI 
for clarity and structure. All code implementation, execution, 
and conceptual understanding were performed by me as part of 
my computational practice.
